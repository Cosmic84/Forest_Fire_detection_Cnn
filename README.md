# Forest_Fire_detection_Cnn
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras to detect fire in images. Achieved over 93% validation accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Load `model.h5`
3. Use your own images to detect fire

## 📁 Dataset
Images are organized in:
- `Fire/`
- `No Fire/`

> Dataset not included due to size

## 🧠 Model Summary
- 2 Conv layers + Pooling
- Dense(128) + Dropout
- Final sigmoid output

## 📈 Results
- Training Accuracy: 100%
- Validation Accuracy: ~93%
